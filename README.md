# TICKETSBORROW.
I created this with azure static web apps and azure SQL database 
It contains html code and a database picture.
U can give your details in my webpage . 




I have seen that in any kind of emergency in railway their tickets , when a situation occurs they are wasting tickets and cancelling the journey by wasting Money and Paper printing of railway tickets (***while having any kind of emergency***) ! I think this is not correct because wasting our central government's expenditure is not good and regulating rules of corona ot any other future diseases by going handy to other people Avoiding gathering of people by leaving Railway station by wasting their money . So I have an Interface .. which is described in Problem Description.Hope this Applies to Reservation tickets also

So you can see my code also. 
THIS IS MY GitHub LINK
*To save money and paper printing and to avoid any kind of disease that can be attacked to individuals...! *I am trying to solve money problem *I have seen that passenger tickets doesn't contain PNR number with any kind of passenger name on ticket and people are wasting money , so I have made a opportunity where people can save money and give the same ticket to any other passenger , so that they don't waste money even a single rupee by avoiding going and asking to other passengers by hand by hand so that they can re use their already booked PASSENGER ticket and uploading their NAME and details of there ticket in my website going to same route from SOURCE to DESTINATION Location .
